========== Description ==========

The project is for scripts that need to run as cron job for the monthly metrics project.

========== groups_get.rb ==========

Purpose:
-------
Get the HTML files for the Google groups pages with the stats and download them, since
Google Groups has no F***ing API and they wipe out the top posters for the month on the 
first day of every month. Grrr.

Running the program:
-------------------

ruby groups_get.rb [optional: data directory name] [optional: config.yaml directory name]

Takes 2 arguments:
  1: Optional existing directory name (no trailing /) where the output will be stored.
     Defaults to 'data' in local directory.
  2: Optional directory name (no trailing /) where config.yaml is stored.
     Defaults to local directory.
  Aborts if too many arguments are provided.
  Note: You will need both of these arguments to run it from cron.

Reads group names from a YAML config file (see below)

Output is one html file for each Google Group specified saved in a file named 
[group name]-MM-DD-YY:MIN:SEC.txt

Designed to run as a cron job on the last day of every month.

========== config.yaml ==========

Configuration file where Google Group names are stored. 

An example config.yaml is included using the Google Groups that I normall gather data on.

Format:
groups:
 - "puppet-users"
 - "puppet-dev"
 - "puppet-razor"

========== To Do ==========

* Need to replace the wget calls with something more Ruby-like.
* Need to use something like awk to filter and extract the important bits from the 
  html file.
