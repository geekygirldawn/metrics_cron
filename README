========== Description ==========

The project is for scripts that need to run as cron job for the monthly metrics project.

========== groups_get.rb ==========

Purpose:
-------
Get the HTML files for the Google groups pages with the stats and download them, since
Google Groups has no F***ing API and they wipe out the top posters for the month on the 
first day of every month. Grrr.

Running the program:
-------------------

ruby groups_get.rb [optional directory name as argument]

Takes 1 argument: an existing directory name (no trailing /) where the output will be 
stored.

If no arguments: defaults to data as local directory name. 

Output is one html file for each Google Group specified saved in a file named 
[group name]-MM-DD-YY:MIN:SEC.txt

Designed to run as a cron job on the last day of every month.

To Do:
-----
* Right now, the group names are hard-coded. These should be pulled from a 
  configuration file.
* Need to replace the wget calls with something more Ruby-like.
* Need to use something like awk to filter and extract the important bits from the 
  html file.
