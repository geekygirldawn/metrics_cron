========== Description ==========

The project is for scripts that need to run as cron job for the monthly metrics project.

This is also the first Ruby code that I've ever written from scratch, so go easy on me :)
but I do welcome constructive feedback on how to make it better.

========== groups_get.rb ==========

Purpose:
-------
Get the HTML files for the Google groups pages with the stats and download them, since
Google Groups has no F***ing API and they wipe out the top posters for the month on the 
first day of every month. Grrr.

Running the program:
-------------------

ruby groups_get.rb [optional: data directory name] [optional: config.yaml directory name]

Takes 2 arguments:
  1: Optional existing directory name (no trailing /) where the output will be stored.
     Defaults to 'data' in local directory.
  2: Optional directory name (no trailing /) where config.yaml is stored.
     Defaults to local directory.
  Aborts if too many arguments are provided.
  Note: You will need both of these arguments to run it from cron.

Reads group names from a YAML config file (see below)

Output For Each Google Group:
----------------------------
* An html file for each Google Group specified saved in a file named 
  [group name]-MM-DD-YY:MIN:SEC.txt
* A YAML file with aggregated monthly posts data in a file named
  [group name]-MM-DD-YY:MIN:SEC-monthly.yaml 
* A YAML file with per user posts for top 10 users (all time & monthly) in a file named
  [group name]-MM-DD-YY:MIN:SEC-users.yaml
* An intermediate file kept only for debugging purposes
  [group name]-MM-DD-YY:MIN:SEC-users.txt

Designed to run as a cron job on the last day of every month.

========== config.yaml ==========

Configuration file where Google Group names are stored. 

An example config.yaml is included using the Google Groups that I normall gather data on.

Format:
groups:
 - "puppet-users"
 - "puppet-dev"
 - "puppet-razor"

========== To Do ==========

* Convert sequential command line arguments to options (-d datadir, -c configfilepath, etc.)
* Add option to email results (as a command line argument / option -e emailaddress)
* Need to replace the wget calls with something more Ruby-like.
* Maybe add a new program to grab the IRC stats?
